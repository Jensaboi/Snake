1.[x] Make a gameboard where everything gets drawn.
    -Show press key buttons text before start of game.      

2. [x] Make apple randomly spawn on board.
    - if snake eats apple
        -delete apple.
        -spawn new apple.
        - only spawn where snake isnt?

3. [x] Make Snake.
    -check for collision (wall/self)
    -change direction
        -LEFT
        -UP
        -RIGHT
        -DOWN                            //fixed (setIntervall felt laggy, requestAnimation smooth, but doesnt do what i want atm.)
        -only be able to move when BLOCKSIZE % === 0 ? (trying to figure out how i can make all moves in a grid like system)
    - add eatApple function
        -add one block to snake body.
        -(thinking i can save the (x,y) where snake ate apple, and drawBody)
        -add one to first place in list, remove last item.


4. [] Score = apples eaten?.
    -apple eaten = score++

5. Gameover function.
    -render gameover text
    -show score.
    -create buttons.
